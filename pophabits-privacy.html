  <h1>Pop. — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="date">Last updated: 27 February 2026</div>

  <p>Pop. is a habit tracking app. This policy explains how it handles your data. The short version: it doesn't collect any.</p>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>Pop. does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. All your habit data (habits, progress, streaks, and scores) is stored locally on your device and never leaves it.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>Pop. does not use any analytics, tracking, or crash reporting tools. There are no third-party SDKs that collect data.</p>

  <h2>Accounts</h2>
  <p>Pop. does not require or support user accounts. There is no sign-up, login, or authentication of any kind.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>Pop. includes a blueprint sharing feature that lets you export your habit setup as a text code. This only happens when you explicitly choose to share, using your device's built-in share sheet. No data is sent to us.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>Pop. loads fonts from Google Fonts when the app starts. This is the only external network request the app makes. Google's privacy policy applies to that request.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Pop. does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here.</p>
